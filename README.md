## Usage
### CLI
You can use the `poe-auth` command to authenticate to https://poe.com/login and get a login session cookie. To use it, run the command with the appropriate options.

```bash
poe-auth --email your.email@example.com
```

```

### Module
You can also use this package as a module. To do so, import the `PoeAuth` class and instantiate it.

```python
from poe_auth import PoeAuth

auth = PoeAuth()

# Send a verification code to your email
email = input("Enter your email: ")
auth.send_verification_code(email)

# Authenticate by entering the verification code
verification_code = input("Enter the verification code: ")
sess_cookie = auth.login_using_verification_code(verification_code=verification_code, email=email)

# Print the session cookie
print(sess_cookie)
```

The script will send a verification code to your email or phone number, depending on the option you choose. Enter the verification code when prompted, and the script will authenticate to https://poe.com/login and display the session cookie. You can now use this cookie for this [api](https://github.com/ading2210/poe-api).
