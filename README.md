# poe-auth

poe-auth is a command line tool to automate the obtention of a session token from [Quora's Poe](https://poe.com).

**UPDATE**: This library is currently **broken** as Quora's Poe can detect when sending automated queries. 
If someone know how to bypass that, feel free to contribute.

## Installation

You can install this package using pip
    
```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/krishna2206/poe-auth.git
```

## Usage
### CLI
You can use the `poe-auth` command that will be installed in your system. 
It has two options: `--email` and `--phone`. 
You can use either one of them to authenticate to Poe.

```bash
poe-auth --email your.email@example.com
```

or

```bash
poe-auth --phone +33601234567
```

### Module
You can also use this package as a module. To do so, import the `PoeAuth` class and instantiate it.

#### V1 (Reverse engineered API)
```python
from poe_auth.V1 import PoeAuth

auth = PoeAuth()
```

#### Login/Signup using email

##### V1 (Reverse engineered API)
```python
# Send a verification code to your email
email = input("Enter your email: ")
status = auth.send_verification_code(email)

# Authenticate by entering the verification code
verification_code = input("Enter the verification code: ")
if status == "user_with_confirmed_email_not_found":
    session_token = auth.signup_using_verification_code(
        verification_code=verification_code, mode="email", email=email_adress)
else:
    session_token = auth.login_using_verification_code(
        verification_code=verification_code, mode="email", email=email_adress)

# Print the session token
print(session_token)
```

#### Login/Signup using phone number

##### V1 (Reverse engineered API)
```python
phone = input("Enter your phone number: ")
status = auth.send_verification_code(phone, mode="phone")

# Authenticate by entering the verification code
verification_code = input("Enter the verification code: ")
if status == "user_with_confirmed_phone_number_not_found":
    session_token = auth.signup_using_verification_code(
        verification_code=verification_code, mode="phone", phone=phone_number)
else:
    session_token = auth.login_using_verification_code(
        verification_code=verification_code, mode="phone", phone=phone_number)

# Print the session token
print(session_token)
```

The script will send a verification code to your email or phone number, depending on the option you choose. 
Enter the verification code when prompted, and the script will authenticate to Poe and display the session token. 
You can now use this token for this [API](https://github.com/ading2210/poe-api).
